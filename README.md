# E-commerce Site - From My Table to Yours

_A web app made with Ember 2 that simulates an e-commerce website for gourmet foods and drinks. Uses Google Firebase to store data for items and feedback comments. Items and feedback have a one-to-many relationship respectively. Items are sorted into different routes/components based on the category of food or drink through the use of Firebase queries. Feedback may be added to an item detail page with star ratings. Users may add itesm to their shopping cart and the number of items in cart will always be displayed to the user in the navigation bar._
